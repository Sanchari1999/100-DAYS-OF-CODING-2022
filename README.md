DAY 010/100: 10 MARCH 2022

      Basic HTML and HTML5: FREECODECAMP SOLUTIONS (Part 01)
      
      (i)    Change your h1 element's text to say "Hello World".
      (ii)   Add an h2 tag that says "CatPhotoApp" to create a second HTML element below your "Hello World" h1 element.
      (iii)  Create a p element below your h2 element, and give it the text Hello Paragraph.
      (iv)   Replace the text inside your p element with the first few words of this kitty ipsum text: Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.
      (v)    Uncomment your h1, h2 and p elements.
      (vi)   Comment out your h1 element and your p element, but not your h2 element.
      (vii)  Delete your h1 element so we can simplify our view.
      (viii) Create a second p element with the following kitty ipsum text: Purr jump eat the grass rip the couch scratched sunbathe, shed everywhere rip the couch sleep in the sink fluffy fur catnip scratched. Then, create a main element and nest only the two p elements inside the main element.
      (ix)   Within the existing main element, insert an img element before the existing p elements. Now set the src attribute so that it points to the url https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg Finally, don't forget to give your img element an alt attribute with applicable text.
      (x)    Create an a element that links to https://www.freecatphotoapp.com and has "cat photos" as its anchor text.
      (xi)   Change your external link to an internal link by changing the href attribute to #footer and the text from cat photos to Jump to Bottom. Remove the target="_blank" attribute from the anchor tag since this causes the linked document to open in a new window tab. Then add an id attribute with a value of footer to the <footer> element at the bottom of the page.
      (xii)   Nest the existing a element within a new p element. Do not create a new anchor tag. The new paragraph should have text that says View more cat photos, where cat photos is a link, and the rest is plain text.
      (xiii)  The current value of the href attribute is a link that points to "https://www.freecatphotoapp.com". Replace the href attribute value with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to create a dead link.
      (xiv)   Place the existing image element within an a (anchor) element. Once you've done this, hover over your image with your cursor. Your cursor's normal pointer should become the link clicking pointer. The photo is now a link.
      (xv)    Remove the last two p elements and create an unordered list of three things that cats love at the bottom of the page.
      (xvi)   Create an ordered list of the top 3 things cats hate the most.
      (xvii)  Create an input element of type text below your lists.
      (xviii) Set the placeholder value of your text input to "cat photo URL".
      

DAY 011/100: 11 MARCH 2022
      
      Basic HTML and HTML5: FREECODECAMP SOLUTIONS (Part 02)
      
      (xix)    Nest the existing input element inside a form element and assign "https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo" to the action attribute of the form element.
      (xx)     Add a button as the last element of your form element with a type of submit, and Submit as its text.
      (xxi)    Make your text input a required field, so that your user can't submit the form without completing this field. Then try to submit the form without inputting any text. See how your HTML5 form notifies you that the field is required?
      (xxii)   Add a pair of radio buttons to your form, each nested in its own label element. One should have the option of indoor and the other should have the option of outdoor. Both should share the name attribute of indoor-outdoor to create a radio group.
      (xxiii)  Add to your form a set of three checkboxes. Each checkbox should be nested within its own label element. All three should share the name attribute of personality.
      (xxiv)   Give each of the existing radio and checkbox inputs the value attribute. Do not create any new radio or checkbox elements. Use the input label text, in lowercase, as the value for the attribute.
      (xxv)    Set the first of your radio buttons and the first of your checkboxes to both be checked by default.
      (xxvi)   Nest your "Things cats love" and "Top 3 things cats hate" lists all within a single div element. Hint: Try putting your opening div tag above your "Things cats love" p element and your closing div tag after your closing ol tag so that both of your lists are within one div.
      (xxvii)  Add a DOCTYPE tag for HTML5 to the top of the blank HTML document in the code editor. Under it, add opening and closing html tags, which wrap around an h1 element. The heading can include any text.
      (xxviii) Edit the markup so there's a head and a body. The head element should only include the title, and the body element should only include the h1 and p.

DAY 012/100: 12 MARCH 2022

      Basic CSS: FREECODECAMP SOLUTIONS (Part 01)

      (i)    Change your h2 element's style so that its text color is red.
      (ii)   Delete your h2 element's style attribute, and instead create a CSS style block. Add the necessary CSS to turn all h2 elements blue.
      (iii)  Inside your style element, change the h2 selector to .red-text and update the color's value from blue to red. Give your h2 element the class attribute with a value of red-text.
      (iv)   Classes allow you to use the same CSS styles on multiple HTML elements. You can see this by applying your red-text class to the first p element.
      (v)    Inside the same <style> tag that contains your red-text class, create an entry for p elements and set the font-size to 16 pixels (16px).
      (vi)   Make all of your p elements use the monospace font.
      (vii)  Import the Lobster font to your web page. Then, use an element selector to set Lobster as the font-family for your h2 element.
      (viii) To begin, apply the monospace font to the h2 element, so that it now has two fonts - Lobster and monospace. In the last challenge, you imported the Lobster font using the link tag. Now comment out that import of the Lobster font (using the HTML comments you learned before) from Google Fonts so that it isn't available anymore. Notice how your h2 element degrades to the monospace font. Note: If you have the Lobster font installed on your computer, you won't see the degradation because your browser is able to find the font.
      (ix)  Create a class called smaller-image and use it to resize the image so that it's only 100 pixels wide.
      (x)   Create a class called thick-green-border. This class should add a 10px, solid, green border around an HTML element. Apply the class to your cat photo. Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element using its class attribute, by separating each class name with a space. For example: <img class="class1 class2">
      (xi)  You can specify a border-radius with pixels. Give your cat photo a border-radius of 10px. Note: This challenge allows for multiple possible solutions. For example, you may add border-radius to either the .thick-green-border class or the .smaller-image class.
      
DAY 013/100: 13 MARCH 2022

      Basic CSS: FREECODECAMP SOLUTIONS (Part 02)      

      (xii)   Give your cat photo a border-radius of 50%.
      (xiii)  Create a class called silver-background with the background-color of silver. Assign this class to your div element.
      (xiv)   Give your form element the id cat-photo-form.
      (xv)    Try giving your form, which now has the id attribute of cat-photo-form, a green background.
      (xvi)   Change the padding of your blue box to match that of your red box.
      (xvii)  Change the margin of the blue box to match that of the red box.
      (xviii) Try to set the margin to a negative value like the one for the red box. Change the margin of the blue box to -15px, so it fills the entire horizontal width of the yellow box around it.
      (xix)   Give the blue box a padding of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.
      (xx)    Give the blue box a margin of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.
      (xxi)   Use Clockwise Notation to give the .blue-box class a padding of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.

DAY 014/100: 14 MARCH 2022

      Basic CSS: FREECODECAMP SOLUTIONS (Part 03)
      
      (xxii)  Use Clockwise Notation to give the element with the blue-box class a margin of 40px on its top and left side, but only 20px on its bottom and right side.
      (xxiii) Using the type attribute selector, try to give the checkboxes in CatPhotoApp a top margin of 10px and a bottom margin of 15px.
      (xxiv)  Add a padding property to the element with class red-box and set it to 1.5em.
      (xxv)   We can prove that the body element exists here by giving it a background-color of black.
      (xxvi)  First, create a h1 element with the text Hello World. Then, let's give all elements on your page the color of green by adding color: green; to your body element's style declaration. Finally, give your body element the font-family of monospace by adding font-family: monospace; to your body element's style declaration.
      (xxvii) Create a CSS class called pink-text that gives an element the color pink. Give your h1 element the class of pink-text.
      (xxviii) Create an additional CSS class called blue-text that gives an element the color blue. Make sure it's below your pink-text class declaration. Apply the blue-text class to your h1 element in addition to your pink-text class, and let's see which one wins.
      (xxix)   Give your h1 element the id attribute of orange-text. Leave the blue-text and pink-text classes on your h1 element. Create a CSS declaration for your orange-text id in your style element.
      (xxx)    Use an inline style to try to make our h1 element white. Leave the blue-text and pink-text classes on your h1 element.
      (xxxi)   Let's add the keyword !important to your pink-text element's color declaration to make 100% sure that your h1 element will be pink.
      (xxxii)  Replace the word black in our body element's background-color with its hex code representation, #000000.

DAY 015/100: 15 MARCH 2022

      Basic CSS: FREECODECAMP SOLUTIONS (Part 04)
      
      (xxxiii)  Replace the color words in our style element with their correct hex codes: Dodger Blue #1E90FF, Green #00FF00, Orange #FFA500, Red #FF0000. 
      (xxxiv)   Go ahead, try using the abbreviated hex codes to color the correct elements: Cyan #0FF, Green #0F0, Red #F00, Fuchsia #F0F.
      (xxxv)    Let's replace the hex code in our body element's background color with the RGB value for black: rgb(0, 0, 0)
      (xxxvi)   Replace the hex codes in our style element with their correct RGB values: Blue-rgb(0, 0, 255), Red-rgb(255, 0, 0), Orchid-rgb(218, 112, 214), Sienna-rgb(160, 82, 45).
      (xxxvii)  In the penguin class, change the black value to gray, the gray value to white, and the yellow value to orange.
      (xxxviii) In the penguin class, create a variable name --penguin-skin and give it a value of gray.
      (xxxix)   Apply the --penguin-skin variable to the background property of the penguin-top, penguin-bottom, right-hand and left-hand classes.
      (xxxx)    It looks like there is a problem with the variables supplied to the .penguin-top and .penguin-bottom classes. Rather than fix the typo, add a fallback value of black to the background property of the .penguin-top and .penguin-bottom classes.
      (xxxxi)   It looks like a variable is being used to set the background color of the .red-box class. Let's improve our browser compatibility by adding another background declaration right before the existing declaration and set its value to red.
      (xxxxii)  Define a variable named --penguin-belly in the :root selector and give it the value of pink. You can then see that the variable is inherited and that all the child elements which use it get pink backgrounds.
      (xxxxiii) Change the value of --penguin-belly to white in the penguin class.
      (xxxxiv)  In the :root selector of the media query, change it so --penguin-size is redefined and given a value of 200px. Also, redefine --penguin-skin and give it a value of black. Then resize the preview to see this change in action.
