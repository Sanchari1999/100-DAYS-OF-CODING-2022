/*To create an internal link, you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you want to internally link to, usually further down the page. 
You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. 
An id is an attribute that uniquely describes an element.*/

//22. Create a Set of Radio Buttons

  <input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor

  </form>
</main>

/*You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.
Radio buttons are a type of input.
Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside of a label element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.
All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group. By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.*/


//23. Create a Set of Checkboxes
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <form action="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">

    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>


//24. Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <form action="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
    <label for="indoor">
  <input id="indoor" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>
<label for="outdoor">
  <input id="outdoor" value="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor
</label>
  <label for="loving"><input id="loving" value="loving" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
    <label for="lazy"><input id="lazy" value="lazy" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
    <label for="energetic"><input id="energetic" value="energetic" type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label>
    <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
  </form>
</main>

/*When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. 
Inputs of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.
Here, you have two radio inputs. When the user submits the form with the indoor option selected, the form data will include the line: indoor-outdoor=indoor. 
This is from the name and value attributes of the "indoor" input.
If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. 
In this scenario, if the user clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be indoor-outdoor=on, which is not useful. 
So the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option. */


//25. Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <form action="https://www.freecatphotoapp.com/submit-cat-photo">
