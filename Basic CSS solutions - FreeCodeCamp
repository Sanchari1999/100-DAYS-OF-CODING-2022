//01. Change the Color of Text
<h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
</main>

//Note that it is a good practice to end inline style declarations with a ; .


//02. Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements
<style> 
  h2 { 
    color: blue;
  } 
</style>
<h2>CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
</main>

/*Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style rule(s). 
You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style tags. 
Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules.*/


//03. Use a CSS Class to Style an Element
<style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
<main>
  <p>Click here to view more <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>
</main>

//Note that in your CSS style element, class names start with a period. In your HTML elements' class attribute, the class name does not include the period.
